Fibernavigator
==============

The Fibernavigator is a tool designed for a fast and versatile visualization of streamline datasets.

**Welcome new users**

You can find pre-built versions (Windows, OSX) containing all the latest tools on the Releases_ page.

Tutorials
---------
New rs-fMRI and real-time fiber tractography tutorials soon available: `Tutorial Page`_.
New **video tutorials** of the Fibernavigator are available.

- `Scene navigation`_: how to interact with the 3D view, move planes, etc.
- `Mesh display and interaction`_: how to create and modify the display of meshes.
- `Drawing tool`_: how to draw on empty or already existing anatomies.
- `Fiber navigation`_: how to interact with fibers and select a subset of them.
- `Opacity rendering`_: how to generate orientation-dependent opacity rendering.
- `Tractography-driven resting-state fMRI`_: how to combine dMRI with fMRI.

A list of all tutorials can be seen on the `tutorials`_ page.

Highlights:
-----------

- Fast and efficient visualization of the results of deterministic and probabilistic tractograms.
- Interactive selection of fibers.
- Real-time fiber tractography (Chamberland et al. 2014, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics).
- Tractography-driven resting-state fMRI (Chamberland et al. 2015, Frontiers in Neuroscience).
- Orientation-dependent opacity rendering (Tax et al. 2015, PLoS ONE).
- Display of MRI & functional MRI. `Image Gallery`_

How to get the application
--------------------------

- `Build instructions for Ubuntu`_ and other Linux distributions are provided
- Windows/Mac builds are available on the Releases_ page. (32bit, 64bit version to come later).

Development and contact with the team
-------------------------------------

- Issues can be submitted in the `issue tracker`_.
